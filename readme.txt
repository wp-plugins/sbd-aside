The SBD Aside plugin is a WordPress plugin that allows bloggers to easily create small side-bars for there entries, called asides.

== Description ==


I recommend against using this plugin with the WordPress Visual Editor, as I have not tested it with the visual editor, and will not support the use of the plugin through the Visual Editor.

Nice features of SBD Aside include:

* HTML 5 Support. SBD Aside uses the HTML 5 semantic tag <a href="http://html5doctor.com/aside-revisited/" title="Aside element" target="_blank"><code>&lt;aside&gt;</code></a> to play well with search engines and content aggregators.</li>
* Choose left or right placement on the page.</li>
* Choose expanded ("open") style, or collapsible.</li>
* collapsible ones like on the top right of this page can be collapsed or expanded by the reader as required.</li>
* Choose round corners or square cut.</li>
* Choose background colour.</li>
* Choose width in pixels or percent.</li>
* Choose from one of two caption underline styles.</li>
* Display a caption</li>
* All of the above options/settings are optional. Define your own defaults in the plugin's setting page.</li>
* The styling for the aside is compact, with a small font and low margins. This minimises space disruption to the main article.</li>
